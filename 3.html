<h2>IOT</h2>
<p>The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability,
 software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other 
 communications networks.Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to 
 the public internet, they only need to be connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory">network</a> and
 be individually addressable.</p>
<p>The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, 
increasingly powerful embedded systems, as well as machine learning. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless
 sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable
  the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept
   of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras,
    and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with 
    that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.</p>
<p>There are a number of concerns about the risks in the growth of IoT technologies and products, 
especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently, industry and governmental moves to
 address these concerns have begun, including the development of international and local standards, guidelines,
  and regulatory frameworks.</p>
