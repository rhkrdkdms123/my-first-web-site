<h2>What is 'accessible gaming' and why is it important?</h2>
<p>
Gaming is more popular than ever. 2020 is shaping up to be a big year for the industry;
not only will it welcome the next generation of big consoles in the form of the <a href="https://justaskthales.com/en/

It also saw the release of the Last of Us Part II, which experts have hailed as the <a

This is an important landmark for the gaming industry ? we explain why below.</p>
<strong> What is accessibility in gaming? </strong>
<p>Put simply, accessibility is about ensuring the interface or design of a game works for all gamers,
regardless of disabilities or impairments. There have been considerable steps forward in this area in recent years,
but there have also been challenges too. Every console generation has added new complexity to game control schemes as 
manufacturers seek to introduce variety and novel experiences to gaming. This generation's controllers, for examples, 
have squeezed a slew of functionality into their devices including trackpads, buttons, triggers, analog sticks and 'traditional' 
d-pad controls - considerably heightening complexity.  
At the same time, game designers are constantly looking to push the envelope with in-game features 
that increase the level of immersion for players. This includes directional audio, which can accurately map 
where a sound is coming from, or the removal of the on-screen HUD (or on-screen menu) to help gamers feel more 
involved in the gaming world. Both of these examples could clearly present those with hearing difficulties or visual 
impairments with a challenge, underlining that gaming advances can come at the expense of universal enjoyment.</p>
