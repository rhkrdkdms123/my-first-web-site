<h2>Smart Wheelchair</h2>
Smart Wheelchair is known as a Power Wheelchair that is integrated into multiple sensors, assistive technology,
 and computers that give the user with a disability such as impairment, handicaps, and permanent injury, 
 the required mobility to move freely and safely. These types of wheelchairs are gradually replacing the traditional 
 wheelchairs; however, their expensive costs are preventing a large size of disabled people from having one. According
  to the organization of World Health (WHO), only 5 to 15% out of 70 million disabled people have access to wheelchairs. 
  Therefore, we need to offer a cost-effective Smart that not only minimized the cost but also provides plenty of features 
  that use the latest components and technologies. In the last years, there have been many pleasant efforts that serve this 
  purpose. They have adopted various technologies such as artificial intelligence, where they have designed an autonomous 
  wheelchair that used machine learning concepts to navigate, and some also used Internet of Thing technology to control
   the wheelchair-using voice recognition system. This report will present a cost-effective Smart Wheelchair-based Arduino 
   Nano microcontroller and IoT technology that have several features to gain disabled people, especially poor people who cannot 
   afford expensive Smart Wheelchair, the required help to finish daily life tasks without external help. To conclude this 
   project will make the Smart Wheelchair affordable to a wide range of disabled people and will be based on Arduino Nano, 
   ESP-12e module to give Wi-Fi access, MPU6050 to detect fall with Voice message notification using IFTTT platform, obstacle 
   detection with buzzer and LED to work as hazards, voice recognition system, and joysticks to control the wheelchair.
